# Credit card validator in javascript

This project is a simple javscript program to validate credit card numbers and identify the card type (visa,master etc) using regular expressions.

## How it works

The program uses patterns to match credit card numbers:

**Visa:**  The number starts with 4 and has either 13 or 16 digits.

**Mastercard:** Starts with a number between 51 and 55 and has 16 digits.

**American Express(Amex):**  Starts with 34 or 37 and has 15 digits.

**Each type has a specific pattern that helps determine whether the card number is valid.**
